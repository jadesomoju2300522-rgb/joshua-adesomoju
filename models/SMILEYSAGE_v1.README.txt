SMILEYSAGE_v1 (placeholder)

The live app defaults to the pre-trained model bundled in the `fer` Python package.
If you need a local weight file to ship with the submission, run `python model.py`
after placing a dataset in ./data/train (with subfolders per class). It will save
a toy Keras model to this same folder as `SMILEYSAGE_v1.keras`.

This file exists to document that requirement and explain how to produce the artifact.
